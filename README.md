## Installation
To interact with this application without running your own server on your local machine, use the deployed link, signing in to have more interaction. 

For personal/local use, use the command 'git clone' in your command line with the link of this repo while navigated to your desired directory to copy this repo to your machine, run 'npm install' or 'npm i' in your command line in the root folder of this application to install dependencies required (bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, handlebars, mysql2, sequelize). (note: it is not recommended to update the version of these dependencies, in order to ensure maximum compatability)

## Usage
1. To use your own database and server, create a .env file to store and protect your credentials. reference the config/connection.js set up for variables to include in your env file.
2. To avoid typing in blogposts and users from the front end, use these steps to populate the tech blog database.
    * In your command line while in the root folder of the application, login to the mysql shell using the command 'mysql -u root -p'. If you are using a different mysql user specify that in place of root. You'll insert your password after executing this command.
    * Run 'SOURCE db/db.sql' to start with a fresh database called tech_blog_db. then exit the mysql shell using 'quit;'
    * Add any data you'd like to the seeds.sql file.
    * Run 'npm start' to start the server and initialize the models for table data.
    * Use control-c to close the server, then 'mysql -u root -p' to login to mysql shell again. 
    * Run 'SOURCE db/seeds.sql' to seed your data. then quit; to close out of mysql shell.
    * Your data should now be populated in the database!
3. While still in the application root folder, run the command 'npm start' to initiate the application.
6. You can now login, comment, create and edit posts on the Tech Blog!
